"""The durable `events.jsonl` boundary sequence of successful runs.

Every other test of the string event path pins either the *failure* sequence
(`tests/integration/test_run_fail_loudness.py`) or the writer in isolation, by
calling `RunContext.emit_event` directly
(`tests/unit/test_event_foundation.py`). Neither reaches the emitters, so seven
run-level names had no test tying them to a real run's durable stream:

    model_built            tpen/runner/train.py
    train_start            tpen/runner/train.py
    train_end              tpen/runner/train.py
    checkpoint_restored    tpen/runner/train.py, tpen/runner/evaluate.py
    step_start             tpen/training/trainer.py
    step_end               tpen/training/trainer.py
    run_end                tpen/runner/train.py, tpen/runner/evaluate.py

Deleting any of those emits left the suite green, which matters because
removing the last writer of an event is indistinguishable -- to a green suite --
from removing something nothing used. This module drives three real runs
through `run_from_config` and pins what each one records.

What is asserted is presence, relative order, and multiplicity of the run-level
boundary names, and nothing else. The stream is projected onto
`BOUNDARY_NAMES` before comparison, so a new event name added anywhere in the
lifecycle does not churn these tests; only a change to the boundaries
themselves does. Payload contents are deliberately not asserted -- they are
pinned where they are contractual, in the fail-loudness and unit tests.

Three runs, sharing one module-scoped fixture because each is a real VMC loop:

1. a fresh training run, covering every boundary except `checkpoint_restored`;
2. a training run resumed from run 1's mid-run checkpoint, which is the only
   way `checkpoint_restored` fires on the `Train` path;
3. an evaluation run restoring run 1's terminal checkpoint with
   ``mode: model_only``, covering the `Evaluate` copies of
   `checkpoint_restored` and `run_end`.
