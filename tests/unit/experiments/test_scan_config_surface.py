"""The tpen-pair-scan-v1 slot surface holds the grid's contracts.

The scan drives 288 runs from two base configs through a handful of dotted
override paths. Everything here guards a property that, if it broke, would
produce a green grid whose numbers answer a different question than the one
asked. None of it is style.

The properties, and what each one is defending against:

channels fan-out
    tpen-pair-v1 spells the feature width as four independent literal ``4``s
    (``train.yaml:56,66,75,91``), one per consumer. There is no single override
    that moves all four and no error if only three move. Here one
    ``run_parameters.channels`` reaches every consumer through
    ``model_params.channels``, and a config in which the four could disagree is
    the failure mode these tests exist to make unrepresentable.

embedding activation held at SiLU
    ``activation_slot`` owns the equivariant-op activation only (D2). The
    embedding MLP is a plain feedforward net -- a separate concept -- and is a
    control. Both the config text and the constructed modules are checked,
    because a leak would move two unrelated things per axis step and make the
    activation axis uninterpretable.

three independent seeds
    ``sampler.seed: ${runtime.seed}`` (``train.yaml:28,108``) fuses model
    initialization and the sampler chain. Paired seed rows need validation to
    reproduce a train row's MODEL while drawing a fresh sampler stream, which one
    integer cannot express.

omega / confinement coefficient
    ``coefficient = omega / 2`` with no arithmetic resolver in
    ``tpen/config.py``, so one number is pinned in four places across two files.
    Asserted, not promised by a comment.

train / eval model identity
    Validation restores under ``mode: model_only, strict: true``, which rejects
    any wiring difference.

callbacks at config root
    ``_instantiate_runner`` raises on a runner that declares ``callbacks`` or
    ``loggers`` (``tpen/run.py:343-348``). The mutant that moves them is checked
    against the real guard, not only structurally.

metric provenance
    ``MCMCGenerator`` draws from |psi|^2, so its ``local_energy_mean`` is the
    variational estimator. ``StratifiedGeometryGenerator`` does ``del model``
    (``generators/hooke.py:232``) and draws from a fixed prior, so its mean is
    E_q[E_L] for arbitrary q and is unbounded below; only its VARIANCE is a valid
    objective there. The tests pin which task supplies which key.
