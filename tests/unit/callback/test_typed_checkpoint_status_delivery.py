"""Delivery tests for `Checkpoint` and `Status`, the last two state readers.

Required by the ruling recorded on item ``62593af4``. The dispatcher in
`tpen.artifacts.RunContext._dispatch_occurrence` SKIPS a `StatefulCallback`
whose declared domain does not match the state it was handed, and the same
branch fires when the emitter passes no state at all. Skipping is correct and
specified, but it means an emitter that forgets ``state=`` produces a callback
that observes nothing, silently, with no error anywhere -- the same shape as
defect ``933b5f78``, where `GradientStats` reported ``passed: true`` while
observing zero gradients.

So every migrated callback gets a test asserting it really is delivered its
state at the boundary it subscribes to. These use the REAL dispatcher, and the
end-to-end cases use the REAL runner: a `RunContext` stand-in would override the
very method under test, and only the runner can prove that the emitting SITE
passes state.

`TrainingCompleted` is a brand new event with exactly one emit site, so the
runner-level test below is the one that would catch a forgotten ``state=``
there. Without it the terminal checkpoint would silently stop being written.
