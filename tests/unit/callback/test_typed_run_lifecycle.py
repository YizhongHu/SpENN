"""Delivery and emit-site tests for the typed run lifecycle (item ``39eacd99``).

Two distinct hazards are covered here, and they need different kinds of test.

DELIVERY. Required by the ruling on item ``62593af4``: a migrated callback gets a
test proving it is really reached at the boundary it subscribes to, driven through
the REAL `tpen.artifacts.RunContext` dispatcher, because a `RunContext` stand-in
would override the very routing under test.

THE EMIT SITES. `tpen.run_events` has exactly one emitter, `tpen.run`, and every
delivery test below emits its own events, so all of them would keep passing if
`run_from_config` dropped an emit. A forgotten emit is silent -- no ``config.yaml``,
no ``metadata.json``, no ``runtime/wall_time_sec``, and no error anywhere. The
end-to-end tests drive the real `run_from_config` for that reason, and they are
the only thing standing between that mistake and a run that quietly stops
recording itself.

Also pinned here: `tpen.callback.Status` and `tpen.callback.ArtifactIndex` now
have NO legacy triggers left. The MEASURED reason they once had to, when this
slice landed, was that both are `StatefulCallback`s, the run lifecycle carries no
domain state, and the dispatcher's ``isinstance(state, callback.state_type)``
branch therefore skipped them at every run-level boundary -- silently.

Item ``24f91145`` removed that constraint by moving the gate from per-callback to
per-GROUP, so ``test_a_state_free_run_event_now_reaches_a_stateful_callback``
records the same scenario with the opposite outcome, and the two callbacks
consumed the mechanism directly afterwards. Their own delivery tests live in
``test_status.py`` and ``test_typed_evaluation_delivery.py``.
