"""A non-finite local-energy row is refused, unless masking is chosen on purpose.

The behaviour this replaces was not silent -- non-finite rows were excluded and
counted in ``local_energy_nonfinite_count``. It was still wrong to leave as the
only option, and the reason is statistical rather than procedural.

MASKING IS NOT A RANDOM SUBSAMPLE. Non-finite local energies occur where the
local energy is pathological: near nodes, at coalescence, in the tail, wherever
the wavefunction misbehaves. Those are exactly the regions carrying the physics
being measured. Dropping them selects a subsample SYSTEMATICALLY, so the energy
estimator is biased by an amount nobody has characterised -- and the count tells
you how many rows went, not what bias they took with them. A biased estimator
with a diagnostic attached is still a biased estimator, and it produces a
plausible number rather than a crash.

So masking stays reachable, because a scientist may knowingly want it, but only
by declaring it where the closed schema can see the declaration.
