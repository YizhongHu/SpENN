"""Reviewer probes for SR Lane N, review round 1 (PR 472 / PR 476).

ADOPTED FROM THE DURABLE REVIEWER. Written by the reviewer's test-implementation
lane on `claude/vmc-sr/review-n-r1` @ `fdc460f218d1082ea0dcd362e976ab1672e40ee5`,
accepted in full by the implementation lane and landed here.

The reviewer's single file is SPLIT ACROSS THE TWO STACK LAYERS, by dependency
rather than by preference: T1-T3 exercise only the score geometry and the QGT,
which live in this layer (PR 472), so they land here. T4-T5 need the trainer and
import helpers from `test_sr_trainer_integration`, which exist only in the N3
layer, so they are appended to THIS SAME FILE there (PR 476). Test bodies are
adopted unchanged; only the module docstring and the import list differ from the
reviewer's original, because a layer cannot import what it does not yet contain.

* T1 -- an asymmetric reducer proves score/energy centering is built from the
  reducer's REDUCED total, not from a local `.mean()` that only borrows the
  reducer's count. Reviewer finding F1: the pre-existing `_DoublingReducer`
  probe doubles count AND sum, leaving the reduced mean equal to the local
  mean, so a local-mean mutant passed the whole suite. Proven by reviewer
  mutant M1.
* T2 -- the QGT singular guard is bidirectional: it refuses a matrix truly
  singular at the tolerance boundary, and does NOT refuse a well-conditioned
  matrix whose smallest eigenvalue is merely small but legitimate. Reviewer
  finding F2: the guard was tested only in the refuse direction, so an
  over-closed guard (mutant M2) passed.
* T3 -- probes this lane's own receipt claim that a fixed score seam emitting
  exactly-zero score columns for structurally inactive parameters needs no
  change on the SR side. Reviewer finding F3. The claim HOLDS; landing the test
  keeps the future 2-electron unblock (item `68711cfd`) from regressing here.
* T4 -- a checkpoint state carrying a stateful SR method's envelope is
  `json.dumps`-serializable and round-trips exactly. Reviewer finding F6: the
  checkpoint regression this lane self-caught (job 44572457, Adam optimizer
  tensors leaking into `trainer.json`) had no direct JSON pin, so a future
  warm-start tensor in the envelope would reintroduce it undetected.
* T5 -- resuming a stateful method from state missing the `update_method` key
  must RAISE rather than silently leave the method's counters unrestored.
  Reviewer finding F4; this probe was RED on delivery and is green here against
  the fix in `VMCTrainer.load_state_dict`.

Tolerances mirror the sibling contract-test modules this file draws its helpers
and conventions from: float64 problems, `1e-9`-`1e-12` for well-conditioned
direct comparisons, with an explicitly looser and explicitly justified tolerance
in T2(a) where the construction sits deliberately near the edge of float64's
numerical rank.

    Lane N's receipt (see `test_score_seam_blocks_sr_on_a_two_electron_tpen_model`

    that once the score seam is fixed, structurally inactive parameters --
    the g0..g14-type dead coordinates at 2 electrons -- will emit exactly-zero
    score columns, and that this needs NO change on the SR side. This builds a
    synthetic engine-level problem with a contiguous block of all-zero score
    columns mixed with live ones, under positive damping, and checks:

    * both solve routes succeed;
    * the returned direction is exactly zero (<= 1e-14) on the dead
      coordinates;
    * the live-coordinate sub-direction matches the NumPy oracle computed on
      the REDUCED (live-columns-only) problem;

    Damping uses `relative=0.0` deliberately: the shift would otherwise be
    anchored to `trace(S) / P` with P counting the dead coordinates, which

    shift purely from a different P, confounding the comparison with an
    artifact of the damping formula rather than the claim under test.
