"""Build a StagePlanV2 of independent ferminet-codebase rows, one per seed.

SYSTEM AND ANSATZ ARE BOTH ARGUMENTS.

SYSTEM IS AN ARGUMENT, NOT A COPY. An earlier design kept one builder per system
(`rung_makeplan.py` for H2, `rung_makeplan_he.py` for He) differing in four
lines. Production job 7579539 then ran H2 while labelled He, because the
production script was derived from a local copy that had never received the
He substitution -- applied remotely with `sed -i` -- and the pre-submission
check invoked the He builder BY NAME, validating a code path the job never took.
A single parameterised builder removes that class of error: there is nothing to
pick wrongly.

`build_plan` gives every row the SAME argv (test_plan.py:33 asserts it), which
would run four identical seeds -- exactly the defect that silently produced
identical rows on Cannon.  The dispatch layer does support per-row argv
(`admit_tasks(argv_by_runtime=...)`: "one exact argv per entry of tasks"), so
the plan is constructed directly with per-row LogicalTaskSpec commands.

L0 tests DISPATCH, not science: 300 steps is enough to prove four rows ran
independently on four distinct GPUs with four distinct seeds.
