@dataclass
class TrainerState(TrainingTimingState):
    """Snapshot of the VMC training loop at one step.

    This is the training domain's `DomainState`: the trainer passes it beside
    every typed occurrence it emits, and a `tpen.callback.StatefulCallback`
    declaring ``state_type = TrainerState`` receives it as a typed handler
    argument.

    The state is updated in place each step and handed to callbacks (notably
    `tpen.callback.Checkpoint`) through ``Event.state``. Fields beyond
    ``step``/``metrics`` carry the most recent loop artifacts for inspection.

    Parameters
    ----------
    step : int, optional
        Index of the most recently completed step (0-based; ``-1`` before the
        first step).
    metrics : dict, optional
        Scalar metrics logged for the most recent step.
    optimizer_step : bool, optional
        Whether the most recently completed iteration applied an optimizer
        update. ``False`` before the first step, and on any iteration that
        deliberately skipped its update (the zero-electron vacuum). This is the
        in-process typed carrier of the same fact the ``train/optimizer_step``
        metric publishes durably, and `tpen.metrics_naming` documents it as the
        authoritative discriminator between "no update happened" and "an update
        happened". A health callback that observes update by-products needs it
        to tell an empty observation apart from a legitimately empty iteration.
    model : Any, optional
        Wavefunction model being optimized.
    optimizer : Any, optional
        Optimizer driving the model parameters.
    trainer : Any, optional
        Trainer object owning train-loop progress state.
    sampler : Any, optional
        Sampler producing walker configurations.
    samples : Any, optional
        Most recent walker state, when retained.
    batch : Any, optional
        Most recent electron batch.
    local_energy : Any, optional
        Most recent per-sample local energy (detached).
    loss : torch.Tensor or None, optional
        Most recent surrogate loss (detached).
    wavefunction_output : WavefunctionOutput or None, optional
        Most recent wavefunction output (signed-log form) for the batch.
    sampler_stats : SamplerStats or None, optional
        Most recent typed sampler diagnostics, or ``None`` before the first
        collection.
    timing : TrainingTiming or None, optional
        Most recent whole-iteration timing, or ``None`` before the first
        completed iteration.
