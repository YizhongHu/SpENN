# Acceptance is mode-dependent, not global. ``model_only`` reads `model.pt` and
# the config hashes, both of which a v1 manifest carries, so an archived
# artifact still restores weights.
#
# ``train_resume`` refuses every v1 manifest because a v1 manifest cannot prove
# which `trainer.json` key set it carries. B1 renamed the trainer keys from
# `global_step`/`completed_steps` to `next_iteration`/`completed_updates`
# *without* bumping the manifest schema, so schema_version 1 covers both: an
# artifact written before B1 is genuinely unresumable, while one written after
# B1 would resume fine. The version cannot tell them apart, so all v1 is
# refused rather than guessed. This is a rejection, not a migration -- the two
# populations are not distinguishable well enough to upgrade either.
#
# Note the reason is *not* that the restore path reads
# `manifest.completed_updates`: it does not. That path takes trainer state from
# `trainer.json` via `_load_trainer`, and the manifest counters only reach
# `RestoreReport`.
