    Parameters
    ----------
    schema_version : int
        Manifest schema version. `CHECKPOINT_SCHEMA_VERSION` for anything
        written by this package; `LEGACY_CHECKPOINT_SCHEMA_VERSION` for an
        archived artifact.
    kind : str
        Artifact kind. Pinned per schema version -- v2 uses `CHECKPOINT_KIND`,
        v1 keeps `LEGACY_CHECKPOINT_KIND`.
    next_iteration : int
        Trainer resume cursor at write time: the iteration a ``train_resume``
        run continues from. This is the checkpoint's directory identity.
    completed_updates : int or None
        Optimizer updates that had actually been applied at write time. The
        two counters diverge whenever a completed iteration skipped its
        update. ``None`` for a v1 manifest, which never recorded it.
    created_at_unix : float
        Wall-clock write time.
    files : dict
        Component name to checkpoint-relative file name.
    hashes : dict
        Component config hashes used to gate restores.
    runtime : dict
        Device/dtype/torch metadata for the writing process.
    provenance : dict
        Run, git, host, and package-version metadata.
