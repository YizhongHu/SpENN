"""Single-write, torn-tail-safe appends for line-oriented artifact files.

TPEN's run artifacts are append-only, line-oriented files -- ``publications.jsonl``,
``events.jsonl``, ``occurrences.jsonl``, the rank-local resource profiles, and the
metric logs.  They live on Netscratch, which is NFS.  This module owns the single
primitive every one-record-per-open writer uses to extend such a file, so that the
torn-write invariant has exactly one implementation rather than one per call site.

What this module does NOT rely on
---------------------------------
It relies on **neither** of the two guarantees a reader might reasonably assume.

*Atomicity of a single* ``write(2)`` *to a regular file.*  POSIX grants atomicity
only for writes to a pipe or FIFO below ``PIPE_BUF``.  A write to a regular file
may store fewer bytes than requested -- on ``ENOSPC``, on inode exhaustion, or on
a signal -- and it is allowed to do so silently by returning a short count.

*``O_APPEND`` offset resolution on NFS.*  NFSv3 has no server-side append
operation.  The client resolves the current end of file and then writes at that
offset, so two clients can obtain the same offset and overwrite one another.
``O_APPEND`` therefore does not hold across NFS clients at all.  Under a single
writer this is immaterial; under concurrent writers it is unfixed here and is
the separate concern of rank-sharding in the distributed program.

What it does provide
--------------------
1. **One write call per record.**  The record and its terminating newline are
   encoded together and handed to an *unbuffered* binary handle, so exactly one
   ``write`` reaches the kernel.  This narrows the interruption window to a
   single kernel-visible operation; it does not make that operation atomic.
2. **Detection instead of silence.**  A short write raises
   :class:`PartialAppendError` rather than returning normally, so *a reported
   short write cannot be mistaken for success*.  That is the whole of the
   claim.  It is NOT "a caller can never mistake a torn record for a stored
   one": a full-count return means the bytes were handed to the kernel, not
   that they are durable.  No ``fsync`` is issued, and on NFS a later client,
   server, or system failure can still lose or tear a record this function
   reported as written.
3. **Bounded damage.**  If a record is nevertheless left unterminated, the next
   append terminates it *in the same single write* that stores the new record.
   The new record therefore lands on its own line instead of being concatenated
   onto the torn bytes.  Without this, one interrupted append destroys the *next*
   record too -- a strictly worse outcome than losing the interrupted one.

The resulting guarantee is precise and deliberately modest: **damage from a torn
write is bounded to the torn record itself and is detectable when the file is
read.**  It is *not* "torn writes cannot occur", which is unachievable on the
filesystem these files actually live on.

Three things this module relies on that are easy to miss
--------------------------------------------------------
**A short write is NOT retried, and that is a behaviour change.**  The previous
text-mode path wrapped a ``BufferedWriter``, which loops the raw handle until
every byte is stored, so a partial store was completed transparently.  This
module raises instead.  Under ``O_APPEND`` with a single writer a bounded retry
would be safe -- the remainder lands at the new end of file -- so completion was
available and was deliberately not taken: a caller that believes a record was
stored when it was not is the failure this module exists to prevent, and under
``ENOSPC``, the dominant case on a quota-bound filesystem, a retry fails anyway.
The cost is real: a partial store followed by a signal now loses a record the
old path would have completed.  Revisiting this is tracked separately.

**Callers that swallow ``OSError`` now swallow this too.**  Subclassing
``OSError`` keeps existing handlers working, which is the point -- but "callers
already treat storage failures that way" is not uniformly true.  Of the sites
reached from an append, ``tpen/checkpoint/receipt.py`` logs a warning, and
``tpen/callback/resource_usage.py`` has one commented best-effort ``pass`` and
one bare ``pass`` with no log at all.  At the latter a partial append is now
silent AND leaves a torn line behind.  That is bounded to rank-local telemetry,
whose reader skips bad rows, but it is not the same as being handled.

**Records must encode to ASCII.**  The readers open these files as UTF-8 text.
A torn write that split a multi-byte character raises ``UnicodeDecodeError``
from the file iteration itself, before any per-row error handling -- so the
torn-row diagnosis is bypassed and the operator gets no repair guidance.  This
cannot happen today only because every routed writer uses ``json.dumps`` with
its default ``ensure_ascii=True``.  That invariant is depended on here and is
pinned by a test; do not weaken it without changing the readers.
