class RuntimeEquivariance(StatefulCallback[TrainerState]):
    """Schedule one or more runtime equivariance checkers.

    The callback owns *when* to run (``every_n_steps``, ``probability``),
    assigns each checker a stable log name, logs its metrics under
    ``checks/equivariance/<name>``, persists any failure artifact under
    ``artifact_dir``, and raises in ``fail_fast`` mode. Each injected checker
    owns *how* to check (permutation selection, comparison) and returns a
    `tpen.equivariance.checks.EquivarianceCheckResult`.

    The callback ``seed`` controls probabilistic *scheduling*; each checker's own
    ``seed`` controls *which permutations* it selects — separate random streams.

    Parameters
    ----------
    checkers : sequence
        Checker objects exposing ``run(state) -> EquivarianceCheckResult``.
        Must be non-empty; see the note below.
    fail_fast : bool, optional
        Raise when any checker fails.
    artifact_dir : str or pathlib.Path or None, optional
        Root directory for failure artifacts. When ``None``, artifacts are not
        written even if a checker returns one.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``checkers`` is empty.

    Notes
    -----
    **An empty checker list is rejected at construction.** Every record this
    callback publishes is emitted from inside the per-checker loop, so with no
    checkers the loop body never runs and the whole ``checks/equivariance/*``
    namespace simply never appears — while a config carrying ``fail_fast: true``
    reads as though equivariance were being enforced. That is worse than a check
    that passes vacuously: a vacuous pass at least leaves a record with counts in
    it that somebody could notice, whereas a vacuous *absence* leaves nothing to
    notice at all.

    Rejecting at construction rather than emitting a failing record at log time
    is deliberate, for three reasons. There is no log name to hang a record on:
    names are derived per checker, so a no-checker record would have to invent a
    ``checks/equivariance/*`` namespace that exists only to describe a
    misconfiguration. It is a configuration error, not an observation, and it is
    fully decidable before any compute is spent. And it is the only option that
    is loud in both modes — a failing record would crash a ``fail_fast: true``
    run late and would never fire at all under ``fail_fast: false``, which is
    precisely the silent case. The cost accepted in exchange is that the error
    surfaces during run setup instead of at the first checked step.

    This is the only migrated callback whose step coordinate reaches a durable
    path name: `_write_equivariance_artifact` formats ``step_{step:06d}``. It is
    read from the typed event so a future boundary change cannot turn it into
    ``step_-00001``. Each checker separately derives its permutation selection
    from the step it reads off the state; at this boundary the two coordinates
    are equal, so no permutation selection moves.
