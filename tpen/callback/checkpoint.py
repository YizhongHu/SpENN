    Parameters
    ----------
    output_dir : str or pathlib.Path
        Directory into which checkpoints are written.
    periodic : bool, optional
        Write a checkpoint for each cadence-eligible completed iteration.
    terminal : bool, optional
        Write one checkpoint when the training loop finishes.
    schedule : CheckpointSchedule or None, optional
        Semantic periodic schedule keyed on durable ``completed_updates``.
        Every configured schedule also admits the terminal boundary; terminal
        publication is never cadence-gated.
    payload : CheckpointPayload or None, optional
        Immutable contract for the files and restore intents this stream
        publishes.  When omitted, the historical all-components payload is
        preserved unless the legacy save flags select another component set.
    keep_last : int or None, optional
        Keep only the latest ``keep_last`` complete checkpoint directories.
    save_optimizer, save_trainer, save_sampler, save_rng : bool or None, optional
        Whether to include train-resume state components.  ``None`` lets an
        explicit payload choose; with no payload, the historical all-component
        default is preserved.
    **kwargs
        Forwarded to `StatefulCallback` (e.g. legacy ``every_n_steps``).

    Notes
    -----
    **Which typed events the two writes land on, and why it matters.**

    The periodic write fires at `tpen.training.events.TrainingIterationCompleted`
    -- the SAME boundary the four ``fail_fast`` health checks fire on -- and not
    at `tpen.training.events.UpdateCompleted`, which reads more naturally
    ("an update completed, persist it") and is therefore the mistake this note
    exists to prevent. ``UpdateCompleted`` is emitted immediately after
    ``optimizer.step()`` returns, i.e. BEFORE any health check can run, so a
    ``fail_fast`` abort would persist the very model version that failed its own
    check and advance ``latest.json`` to it. Sharing the health checks' boundary
    restores the property that a failed check leaves no checkpoint for its step,
    because dispatch within one occurrence is the callback-list loop and an
    exception propagates out of it before later callbacks run.

    That property is pinned by a behavioural test rather than by this comment or
    by callback order (see ``tests/unit/training/test_health_checkpoint_order.py``),
    because ordering alone is an undeclared contract that a config edit would
    break silently.

    ``UpdateCompleted`` is still subscribed, but only to ARM the periodic write:
    it records which iteration applied an optimizer update, and the write at
    ``TrainingIterationCompleted`` is skipped for any iteration that did not.
    A vacuum iteration opens no optimizer scope and emits ``UpdateSkipped``,
    which this callback does not subscribe to, so it arms nothing. Selection is
    unconditional: with no ``every_n_steps`` configured, the periodic path
    writes on every completed update, not on every attempted iteration.

    The terminal write fires at `tpen.training.events.TrainingCompleted`, which
    the runner emits after the loop returns. Update selection deliberately does
    not apply to it: a run whose final iteration skipped its update, and a run
    whose loop body never executed at all, must both still write a terminal
    checkpoint.

    **The two progress counters, and which job each has.**

    Both are required keys of ``trainer.state_dict()`` and are read together on
    every path, so a trainer that cannot report its resume cursor fails loudly
    rather than mislabelling a directory. Neither is ever ``TrainerState.step``,
    whose value is ``-1`` before the first iteration and would render a
    directory named ``step_-00001``.

    ``next_iteration`` is *identity*: it names the checkpoint directory, so a
    restored run continues from exactly the iteration the name encodes. A run
    with ``max_steps=500`` writes its terminal checkpoint as ``step_000500``,
    while training metrics and other step callbacks keep their existing 0-based
    loop step indices.

    ``completed_updates`` is the periodic path's *cadence* coordinate:
    ``every_n_steps`` counts applied optimizer updates, so periodic checkpoints
    are spaced by real training progress rather than by attempted iterations.

    The split is deliberate and both halves are durable, so a resumed run
    checkpoints at the same points an uninterrupted one does. Neither is the
    run-local `tpen.events.Occurrence.count`, which restarts at 1 after a
    restore and would silently shift a resumed run's checkpoint phase.
