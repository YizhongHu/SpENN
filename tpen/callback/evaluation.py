"""Callbacks for evaluation task artifacts and failures.

Importing this module resolves `tpen.evaluation`, and therefore torch, because
`ArtifactIndex` declares its ``state_type`` as a class fact. `tpen.callback`
loads it lazily for that reason; the timing callbacks stay torch-free by
resolving their event types inside ``__init__`` instead, which this module
cannot do for a ClassVar.

    Observes the end of every `tpen.evaluation.events.EvaluationTaskRun` scope

    object (ADR-E008). What it used to do instead is the shape ADR-E007 rejects:
    `tpen.evaluation.results.TaskResult` was flattened into a mapping by
    ``to_payload()`` and re-parsed here with five ``.get()`` probes and a
    ``str(payload.get("namespace", payload.get("name", "")))`` fallback chain --
    defending against a shape the frozen result structurally cannot produce.
