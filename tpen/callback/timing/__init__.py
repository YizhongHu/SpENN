    A `tpen.callback.StatefulCallback` declares its ``state_type`` as a ClassVar,
    which forces the state class to be imported at class-creation time. For the
    evaluation domain that runs `tpen.evaluation`'s ``__init__``, which pulls in
    torch, so `DiagnosticTiming` has to be loaded lazily to keep
    ``import tpen.callback.timing`` torch-free. The callbacks that only need
    event TYPES resolve those inside their ``__init__`` and stay eager.
